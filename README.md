* Predicts the probability of the chasing team winning using a CatBoost model.

2. Automated Predictions

3. Model Performance Tracking

* A dedicated route in the Flask app (/track_model_performance) displays weekly and overall accuracy.

4. Model Training

* The model_training folder includes notebooks and scripts for data preprocessing and CatBoost model training.
